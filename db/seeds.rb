# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#

Product.create([
    { name: "A1", brand: "abc", price: "200$" }, 
    { name: "B1", brand: "abc", price: "201$" }, 
    { name: "C1", brand: "abc", price: "202$" }, 
    { name: "D1", brand: "abc", price: "203$" }, 
    { name: "E1", brand: "abc", price: "204$" }, 
    { name: "F1", brand: "abc", price: "205$" },
